In this Javascript Challenge.
Using the UFO Dataset provided in data.js, the data is presented to the HTML file via Javascript.
Users can then provide inputs on the form in order to look for the UFO sightings form the dataset.

If the provided input does not match any record in the UFO Dataset, the page then refreshes itself after 10 seconds so the User will have no recolleciton on what happened 10 seconds ago.
